# Lavender 🌸

**Smart contract gas optimization service for Ethereum DeFi**

Lavender batches multiple DeFi transactions into single operations, reducing gas costs by 20-40% for common workflows like swap-then-supply or multi-token approvals.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a profitable smart contract service that optimizes gas usage for DeFi power users by batching common transaction patterns into single, efficient operations.

## 💡 Core Value Proposition

- **Gas Savings**: 20-40% reduction in transaction costs
- **Simplified UX**: Multiple DeFi actions in one transaction
- **Revenue Model**: Take 10-20% of gas savings as fees
- **Target Market**: High-frequency DeFi users, yield farmers, arbitrageurs

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Main Components

1. **BatchExecutor Contract** - Core batching logic
2. **Gas Analysis Tools** - Measure and compare optimizations
3. **DeFi Protocol Integrations** - Uniswap, Aave, Compound interfaces
4. **Frontend Interface** - User-friendly transaction builder

### Supported Workflows (Planned)

- **Swap + Supply**: Trade tokens then deposit to lending protocols
- **Multi-token Approvals**: Batch approve multiple tokens
- **Harvest + Compound**: Claim rewards and reinvest
- **Multi-protocol Interactions**: Cross-protocol yield strategies

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation & Analysis** ✅
- [x] Project setup with Hardhat
- [x] Gas analysis tooling and measurements
- [x] DeFi protocol interfaces
- [x] Complete baseline gas analysis (426,933 gas)

**Phase 2: Core Development** ✅  
- [x] Lavender.sol BatchExecutor contract
- [x] swapAndSupply optimization function
- [x] Batch approvals and custom actions
- [x] Comprehensive test suite
- [x] Deployment scripts
- [x] Frontend integration example

**Phase 3: Launch Preparation** 🚧
- [ ] Testnet deployment and testing
- [ ] Security audit and optimization  
- [ ] Frontend deployment
- [ ] Mainnet deployment
- [ ] User acquisition and marketing

## 📊 Gas Analysis Results

**🎯 BASELINE MEASUREMENTS COMPLETE:**

### Complete DeFi Workflow: WETH → USDC → Aave Supply
- **WETH approval for Uniswap**: 46,052 gas
- **WETH → USDC swap (Uniswap V3)**: 113,311 gas  
- **USDC approval for Aave**: 59,987 gas
- **Supply USDC to Aave V3**: 207,583 gas
- **TOTAL BASELINE**: **426,933 gas**

### Lavender Optimization Target
- **Expected Savings**: 20-40% (85k-170k gas)
- **Conservative 25% savings**: 106,733 gas saved
- **User cost savings**: $1.82 USD per transaction (after 15% service fee)
- **Lavender revenue**: $0.32 per transaction

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.28
- **Development**: Hardhat, JavaScript
- **Testing**: Forked Ethereum mainnet
- **Gas Analysis**: Custom measurement tools
- **Integrations**: Uniswap V3, Aave V3, Compound V3

## 📦 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd lavender
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Add your RPC_URL (MetaMask/Infura endpoint)

# Run gas analysis
npx hardhat test test/lavender-baseline-test.js --network hardhat
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run baseline gas analysis  
npx hardhat test test/lavender-baseline-test.js --network hardhat

# Test Lavender contract optimizations
npx hardhat test test/lavender-contract-test.js --network hardhat

# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat

# Deploy to mainnet (after testing)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
```

## 📈 Business Model

1. **Freemium Approach**: Basic batching free, advanced features paid
2. **Fee Structure**: 10-20% of gas savings
3. **Target Revenue**: $10k-50k monthly from gas optimization fees
4. **Growth Strategy**: Start with power users, expand to retail

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Multi-signature admin controls
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Professional smart contract audits
- Gradual rollout with usage limits
